# DevOps Tutorial Repository

Welcome to my DevOps tutorial repository! üéâ

In this repo, I'll be experimenting and learning DevOps concepts by applying industry-standard tools and practices. Each project and tutorial will help me develop the skills necessary to manage and automate the software development lifecycle.

This repository will feature hands-on projects related to:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automating code tests, builds, and deployments.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**: Deploying code to multiple environments automatically.
- **Containerization**: Using Docker for creating containerized applications.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automating infrastructure setup and configuration.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Setting up tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for observability.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1. **Hello World HTML**

My first project is a simple **Hello World** HTML file. This project will be used to demonstrate the basic principles of DevOps such as automation, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment.

#### The HTML File:

üöÄ DevOps Principles and Workflow
Throughout this repository, I will implement the following DevOps practices:

Version Control (Git): Track changes in the codebase, collaboration, and version history.
Continuous Integration (CI): Automate testing and building processes using GitHub Actions.
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Implement automated deployment pipelines for easy delivery of code to multiple environments.
Containerization (Docker): Use Docker to create portable and consistent environments.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automate infrastructure provisioning and management with tools like Terraform or Ansible.
Monitoring & Logging: Set up observability tools to monitor the app‚Äôs performance and logs.
üõ† Tools and Technologies Used
GitHub Actions for CI/CD
Docker for containerization
Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Kubernetes for orchestration (future project)
Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring
Ansible for configuration management
üñäÔ∏è How to Run This Project
To run the basic Hello World HTML file:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/nileshclg/devops-.git
cd devops-
Open the index.html file in your browser.

bash
Copy
open index.html
üí° Upcoming Projects
CI/CD Pipeline Setup: Automate builds and testing with GitHub Actions.
Dockerizing the Hello World App: Containerize the HTML project with Docker for portability.
Cloud Deployment: Set up automated deployment to a cloud provider like AWS or Azure.
Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana: Implement monitoring for real-time metrics.
