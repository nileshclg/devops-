# üöÄ DevOps Principles and Workflow

Throughout this repository, I will implement the following DevOps practices:

- **Version Control (Git)**: Track changes in the codebase, collaboration, and version history.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automate testing and building processes using GitHub Actions.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**: Implement automated deployment pipelines for easy delivery of code to multiple environments.
- **Containerization (Docker)**: Use Docker to create portable and consistent environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automate infrastructure provisioning and management with tools like Terraform or Ansible.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up observability tools to monitor the app‚Äôs performance and logs.

## üõ† Tools and Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for containerization
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Kubernetes for orchestration (future project)
- Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring
- Ansible for configuration management

## üñäÔ∏è How to Run This Project
